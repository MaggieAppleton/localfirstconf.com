Jazz is an open-source toolkit for building apps with distributed state. It offers a clean, high-level API around CoValues (our custom CRDTs) and Groups & Accounts (for permissions & identity, using local cryptography). Jazz includes local persistence and we run a trust-free sync & storage mesh in the cloud for zero-setup, reliable & real-time distributed state.

In our talk we'll build "Circular", a simple issue tracking app. We'll see how CoValues and `useCoState` let you build local-first auto-syncing React apps as quickly as just mocking up a UI. By using Accounts and Groups, we'll get team collaboration features out-of-the box. Finally we'll see how to build decoupled Jazz server workers to interact with GitHub's API.
