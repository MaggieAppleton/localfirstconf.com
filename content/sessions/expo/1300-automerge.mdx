Automerge is a local-first collaborative datastore that runs in the browser and on native platforms. It has a simple API: you modify a JavaScript object and Automerge records changes to that object, synchronizing them with other users. This makes it fast and easy to build real-time, collaborative applications, using familiar tools, and without writing a backend. Automerge also provides powerful APIs for examining and visualizing the history of a document, which supports offline collaboration and sophisticated version control workflows.

This demo will show you how easy it is to integrate Automerge with existing applications to make them collaborative and versioned. We'll start with a simple whiteboarding application using TLDraw and we'll add realtime collaboration and version control using Automerge.
