Yjs has become the go-to solution for building collaborative applications on
the web. It has a rich ecosystem with many editor integrations and
integrates well into existing apps like Evernote.

But what if we rethought existing note-taking apps, started from scratch,
and did everything how it should be done? We would start by implementing an efficient sync protocol that syncs millions of notes efficiently. Our app
should also work well with existing editors like VS Code or Vim. We could
sync notes with the filesystem so that our users really own their data and
can consume it using different editors.

In this live coding session, Kevin, the author of Yjs, will share some
experimental libraries he has been working on. We will build a futuristic
note-taking app that syncs like real-time git.
