Fireproof is the quickest way to add live data to any app or page. It's a realtime document database with zero setup, that runs anywhere. It uses Merkle integrity to prove all replicas are working with the same data, so all transactions are tamperproof and multi-writer replication is safe, making it a strong choice for bringing enterprise workloads to the edge and the browser. Fireproof provides connectors for AWS, Cloudflare, Netlify, and more, so you can use it with any backend. This makes it especially good for open source apps and components that need to store data, but don't want to require an API key to get started.

We'll build out a front-end app together in Replit using Fireproof as the database, then connect it to a cloud endpoint for sync. Once sync is established, we'll write another lightweight UI in a different Replit. You can think of this as the germ of eg, a consumer and admin view over the same data, or other multi-app approaches. By the end of the session you'll be ready to take your fresh app and turn it into something that solves real problems for you and your team.
