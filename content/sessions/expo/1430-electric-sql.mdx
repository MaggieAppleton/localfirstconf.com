ElectricSQL is an open source system for developing local-first software.
ElectricSQL syncs data between Postgres in the cloud and a local database in the client. It provides a reactive, local-first programming model that integrates with React and Expo/React Native and has community bindings for Vue, Svelte, Solid and Flutter, allowing you to build interactive, transactional and offline-capable applications.

Electric aims to be drop-in compatible with existing Postgres data models, so you can take an existing Postgres-based system and progressively expose parts of the data model to new local-first apps and interfaces.

In the session, we'll walk through the process of getting up and running with Electric, including electrifying an existing data model, building a type-safe local data access client and evolving the database schema. We'll then show how you can use either SQLite or PGlite, our lightweight WASM Postgres, as the client side database and how this can be extended to include extensions.

We can then figure out what we want to build together and then keep hacking to collaboratively build out some apps by the end of the day ⚡️
